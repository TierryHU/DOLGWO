Overview


This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Dynamic Opposition-Based Learning Grey Wolf Optimizer (DOLGWO). The DOLGWO algorithm is an enhanced version of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), designed to optimize a variety of objective functions with improved convergence speed and accuracy. The algorithm introduces dynamic opposition-based learning to better explore the search space and avoid local minima, making it suitable for complex optimization problems.


Features


Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO): A population-based metaheuristic inspired by the social hunting behavior of grey wolves.


Dynamic Opposition-Based Learning: This feature enhances the search by dynamically introducing opposite solutions, increasing diversity in the population.


Flexible and Extendable: Easily modify for different optimization problems by providing a custom objective function.
